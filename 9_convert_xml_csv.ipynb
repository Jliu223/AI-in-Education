Let\\'s get started, everyone. So, good afternoon. Welcome to the second lecture of\\n\\t60001 and also of 600. So as always, if you\\'d like to follow along with the lectures, please go\\n\\tahead and download the slides and the code that I\\'ll provide at least an hour before class\\n\\tevery day. All right.\\n\\tSo a quick recap of what we did last time. So last time, we talked a little bit about what a\\n\\tcomputer is. And I think the main takeaway from the last lecture is really that a computer only\\n\\tdoes what it is told, right? So it\\'s not going to spontaneously make decisions on its own. You,\\n\\tas the programmer, have to tell it what you want it to do by writing programs. OK. So we talked\\n\\tabout simple objects. And these objects were of different types. So we saw integers, floats,\\n\\tand Booleans. And then we did a couple of simple operations with them.\\n\\tToday, we\\'re going to look at a different-- a new type of object called a string. And then we\\'re\\n\\tgoing to introduce some more powerful things in our programming toolbox. So we\\'re going to\\n\\tlook at how to branch within a program, and how to make things-- how to make the computer\\n\\trepeat certain tasks within our program.\\n\\tAll right. So let\\'s begin by looking at strings. So strings are a new object type. We\\'ve seen so\\n\\tfar integers, which were whole numbers, floats, which were decimal numbers, and we have\\n\\tseen Booleans, which were true and false. So strings are going to be sequences of\\n\\tcharacters. And these characters can be anything. They can be letters, digits, special\\n\\tcharacters, and also spaces. And you tell Python that you\\'re talking about a string object by\\n\\tenclosing it in quotation marks. So in this case, I\\'m creating an object whose value is h-e-l-l-o\\n\\tspace t-h-e-r-e.\\n\\tAnd Python knows it\\'s a string object, because we\\'re enclosing it in quotations. They can be\\n\\teither double quotes or single quotes, but as long as you\\'re consistent, it doesn\\'t matter. And\\n\\tthis object, we\\'re binding it to this variable named hi. And we\\'re using that using the equals\\n\\tsign, which is the assignment operator. So from now on, whenever we refer to this variable hi,\\n\\tPython is going to say, oh, I know what the value is, and it\\'s that string of characters.\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tRecap of Previous Lecture:\\n\\tA computer only follows explicit instructions and does not make decisions on its own.\\n\\tPreviously covered basic object types: integers, floats, and Booleans.\\n\\tIntroduced simple operations with these objects.\\n\\tIntroduction of a new object type: strings.\\n\\tExploring branching and repetition (control flow).\\n\\tStrings in Python: \\n\\tStrings are sequences of characters, which can include letters, digits, special characters, and spaces.\\n\\tStrings are created by enclosing characters in quotation marks.\\n\\tCan use single or double quotes as long as they are consistent.\\n\\tCreating Strings:\\n\\tExample: \"hello there\" is a string.\\n\\tStrings are objects in Python and can be assigned to variables using the = operator (assignment).\\n\\tExample: hi = \"hello there\".\\n\\tOnce assigned, the variable (e.g., hi) can be used to refer to the string object.\\n\\tAdditional Notes:\\n\\tStrings are treated as a distinct object type in Python, similar to integers, floats, and Booleans.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n\\n</Transcript>\\n<Lecture_Notes>\\n\\t<Text>\\t\\n\\tSTRINGS\\n\\t- letters, special characters, spaces, digits\\n\\t- enclose in quotation marks or single quotes\\n\\thi = \"hello there\"\\n\\t- concatenate strings\\n\\tname = \"ana\"\\n\\tgreet = hi + name\\n\\tgreeting = hi + \" \" + name\\n\\t- do some operations on a string as defined in Python docs\\n\\tsilly = hi + \" \" + name * 3\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tDefinition of Strings:\\n\\tStrings are sequences of characters, including letters, special characters, spaces, and digits.\\n\\tStrings must be enclosed in double quotation marks (\" \") or single quotes (\\' \\').\\n\\tExamples of Strings: \\n\\tExample of string assignment: hi = \"hello there\"\\n\\tConcatenation:\\n\\tStrings can be combined (concatenated) using the + operator.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\tname = \"ana\"\\n\\tgreet = hi + name → Combines hi and name directly.\\n\\tgreeting = hi + \" \" + name → Adds a space between hi and name.\\n\\tString Operations:\\n\\tPython allows additional operations on strings as per its documentation.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\tsilly = hi + \" \" + name * 3 → Repeats name three times, separated by a space.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Lecture_Notes>\\n<Coverage>\\nSimilarity Score: 85%\\nThe transcript and the lecture notes align closely in covering key aspects of strings, their creation, usage, and basic operations. Both sources include the concepts of string definition, concatenation, and examples of manipulating strings.\\n</Coverage> \\n<Missing_Points>\\nOperations on Strings:\\nThe lecture notes explicitly mention that Python allows operations on strings as defined in its documentation.\\nThe example silly = hi + \" \" + name * 3 is also missing from the transcript.\\nDetailed Example Usage:\\nThe transcript lacks some specific examples provided in the lecture notes, such as:\\ngreet = hi + name\\ngreeting = hi + \" \" + name.\\n</Missing_Points>\\n</Lecture_Segment>\\n<Lecture_Segment time= \"3:00-6:00\">\\n<Transcript>\\n\\t<Text>\\n\\tSo we\\'re going to learn about two things that you can do on strings today, two operations. One\\n\\tis to concatenate them. And concatenation is really just a fancy word for using this plus\\n\\toperator, which means put the strings together. So I have this original variable named hi, and I\\n\\tcreate a new variable called name. And in it, I\\'m going to assign the string a-n-a to the variable\\n\\tname. And when I use the plus operator in between hi and name, those two variables, Python\\n\\tis going to look at the values of those two, and it\\'s going to just put them together.\\n\\tOK. I\\'m going to switch to Spider. And this is just that example from the slides. So let\\'s see\\n\\twhat happens. So I have the variable hi, the variable name, and I\\'m just concatenating those\\n\\ttwo together. And then I\\'m going to print that out. So if I run the code, notice it prints out \"hello\\n\\tthereana.\" There\\'s no space. And there\\'s no space because the concatenation operator, the\\n\\tplus, doesn\\'t add any spaces implicitly. So again, another example of just computer just doing\\n\\twhat it\\'s told. If we want to add a space, we\\'d have to actually insert the space manually. So\\n\\tthat\\'s this line here, line 8. And in this line, we\\'re concatenating the value of the variable hi with\\n\\ta space. Notice we\\'re putting it in quotation marks. Just a space. And then with name.\\n\\tSo if we\\'ll go ahead and print that value, notice this was that garbage greeting there. And now\\n\\twe have a proper greeting, right? So that\\'s the concatenation between strings.\\n\\tAnd then the other thing we\\'re going to look at related to strings is the star operator. So that\\'s\\n\\tthis one here on line 10. So Python allows you to use the star operator, which stands for\\n\\tmultiplication, between a string and a number. And when you do that, Python interprets it as\\n\\trepeat that string that many number of times. So in this case, I\\'m creating a silly greeting, and\\n\\tI\\'m concatenating the value of hi, which is \"hello there\" with the space plus the name. So\\n\\tnotice here, I\\'m using parentheses to tell Python, do this operation first, and then multiply\\n\\twhatever the result of this is by 3. So if I print that out, it\\'s going to multiply the space with my\\n\\tname three times, and it\\'s going to concatenate that with \"hello there.\" So that\\'s exactly what it\\n\\tprinted out there.\\n\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tString Concatenation:\\n\\tConcatenation is combining strings using the + operator.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\thi = \"hello there\"\\n\\tname = \"ana\"\\n\\thi + name results in \"hello thereana\".\\n\\tConcatenation does not automatically include spaces between strings.\\n\\tTo include a space, explicitly add it in quotes:\\n\\tExample: hi + \" \" + name results in \"hello there ana\".\\n\\tString Multiplication:\\n\\tThe * operator can be used between a string and a number to repeat the string.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\tname * 3 results in \"anaanaana\".\\n\\tCombining operations:\\n\\t(hi + \" \" + name) * 3 results in \"hello there ana hello there ana hello there ana\".\\n\\tUse of Parentheses:\\n\\tParentheses can define the order of operations in complex expressions involving strings.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\t(hi + \" \" + name) * 3 ensures concatenation happens first, followed by multiplication.\\n\\tPrint Outputs:\\n\\tPython only executes exactly what is programmed.\\n\\tOutput must be explicitly formatted to achieve desired results (e.g., adding spaces in concatenated strings).\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n\\n</Transcript>\\n<Lecture_Notes>\\n\\t<Text>\\t\\n\\thi = \"hello there\"\\n\\tname = \"ana\"\\n\\tgreet = hi + name \\n\\tprint(greet)\\n\\tgreeting  = hi + \" \" + name\\n\\tprint(greeting)\\n\\tsilly = hi + (\" \" + name) * 3\\n\\tprint(silly)\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tString Concatenation (+ Operator):\\n\\tThe + operator combines two or more strings.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\thi = \"hello there\"\\n\\tname = \"ana\"\\n\\tgreet = hi + name results in \"hello thereana\" (no space included automatically).\\n\\tAdding a Space Between Strings:\\n\\tTo include a space between concatenated strings, add \" \" explicitly:\\n\\tgreeting = hi + \" \" + name results in \"hello there ana\".\\n\\tString Multiplication (* Operator):\\n\\tThe * operator repeats a string a specified number of times.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\tsilly = hi + (\" \" + name) * 3:\\n\\tFirst, \" \" + name evaluates to \" ana\".\\n\\tThen, it repeats 3 times: \" ana ana ana\".\\n\\tFinally, it concatenates with hi: \"hello there ana ana ana\".\\n\\tOutput Using print:\\n\\tResults are displayed using the print function:\\n\\tprint(greet) outputs \"hello thereana\".\\n\\tprint(greeting) outputs \"hello there ana\".\\n\\tprint(silly) outputs \"hello there ana ana ana\".\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Lecture_Notes>\\n<Coverage>\\nThe transcript and lecture notes are 95% similar. Both cover the key concepts of string concatenation, the addition of spaces, and string repetition using the + and * operators.\\n</Coverage> \\n<Missing_Points>\\nTranscript Exclusive Points:\\nThe transcript mentions using parentheses to control the order of operations when combining string concatenation and multiplication. This is not explicitly highlighted in the lecture notes.\\nThe transcript emphasizes that Python does exactly what it is told (e.g., it doesn’t add spaces automatically unless explicitly instructed).\\nLecture Notes Exclusive Points:\\nThe lecture notes include Python code examples (greet, greeting, and silly), providing practical illustration of the concepts, which were only described verbally in the transcript.\\n</Missing_Points>\\n</Lecture_Segment>\\n<Lecture_Segment time= \"6:00-9:00\">\\n<Transcript>\\n\\t<Text>\\n\\tLast lecture, we talked a little bit about print. Today, I\\'m going to talk about some nuances\\n\\trelated to print. So you use print to interact with the user. It\\'s cool to write programs that print\\n\\tthings out to the user. So the key word here being print. And then you put parentheses after\\n\\tprint. And in the parentheses, you put in whatever you want to show the user.\\n\\tSo in this little program, I have-- I created a variable named x. I assigned it the value 1, and\\n\\tthen I print 1. Here, I\\'m casting. So I\\'m taking the number one, the integer 1, and I\\'m casting it\\n\\tto a string. And you\\'ll see why in a moment.\\n\\tSo I want to bring to your attention a couple of things here. So in the first print, I\\'m using\\n\\tcommas everywhere here. And in the second print, I\\'m using plus. So by definition, if you-- you\\n\\tcan use commas inside a print-- inside the parentheses of print. And if you use a comma,\\n\\tPython is going to automatically add a space in between the two things that the comma is in\\n\\tbetween, the values. So \"my fav num is\" is the first thing. And the second thing is whatever\\'s\\n\\tafter the comma. Let\\'s take x. So if you use a comma, Python is going to automatically insert a\\n\\tspace for you. \\n\\tSometimes, you might want that, sometimes you might not. If you don\\'t want that, you can use\\n\\tthe concatenation operation, the plus. And you can add all of your little bits together to create\\n\\tone big string. If you\\'re using commas, the items, the objects in between the commas, do not\\n\\tall have to be strings. That\\'s the plus side of using commas. But the downside is you get\\n\\tspaces everywhere. If you use plus operator, the plus side is Python does exactly what you tell\\n\\tit to do, but everything has to be a string object. So \"my fav num is\" is a string object. You\\n\\thave to convert all of your numbers to string objects, and so on.\\n\\tSo if we look at Spider-- This is the same-- almost the same code. So here, I don\\'t have\\n\\tspaces anywhere. So you can see that the first line here has commas everywhere. So I\\'m\\n\\tgoing to have spaces in between every one of the things that I\\'m printing out. This line here is\\n\\tsort of a combination between commas and concatenation. So depending on where I used the\\n\\tcomma, I\\'m going to have an extra space. And this line here just has concatenation\\n\\teverywhere. \\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tGeneral Overview of print\\n\\tThe print function is used to display output to the user.\\n\\tSyntax: print() with parentheses containing the content to be displayed.\\n\\tDifferences Between Using Commas and Plus (+) in print\\n\\tUsing Commas (print(\"text\", variable)):\\n\\tAutomatically adds a space between the items separated by commas.\\n\\tItems in the comma-separated list do not need to be strings (e.g., you can mix strings and numbers).\\n\\tUseful when you want spacing without manually adding it.\\n\\tUsing Plus (print(\"text\" + variable)):\\n\\tCombines strings into a single string without automatic spaces.\\n\\tAll items being concatenated must be explicitly converted to strings (e.g., using str() for non-string types).\\n\\tProvides precise control over formatting, as Python does exactly what you specify.\\n\\tExamples\\n\\tUsing commas:\\n\\tprint(\"My favorite number is\", x) → Output: \"My favorite number is 1\" (space is added automatically).\\n\\tUsing plus:\\n\\tprint(\"My favorite number is \" + str(x)) → Output: \"My favorite number is 1\" (no extra spaces added).\\n\\tCode Demonstration Insights\\n\\tCombining both approaches (commas and concatenation) in one print statement can result in mixed formatting.\\n\\tCommas are simpler but less flexible, while concatenation is precise but requires converting non-strings explicitly.\\n\\tPractical Considerations\\n\\tUse commas when simplicity and automatic spacing are acceptable.\\n\\tUse concatenation for finer control over formatting or when building complex strings.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Transcript>\\n<Lecture_Notes>\\n\\t<Text>\\t\\n\\tINPUT/OUTPUT: print\\n\\t- used to output stuff to console\\n\\t- keyword is print\\n\\tx = 1\\n\\tprint(x)\\n\\tx_str = str(x)\\n\\tprint(\"my fav num is\", x, \".\", \"x =\", x)\\n\\tprint(\"my fav num is \" + x_str + \". \" + \"x = \" + x_str)\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tGeneral Purpose of print\\n\\tPurpose: Outputs information to the console.\\n\\tSyntax: print() with content inside parentheses.\\n\\tExamples of print Usage\\n\\tBasic Usage:\\n\\tOutputs the value of x (e.g., 1).\\n\\tUsing Commas in print:\\n\\tprint(\"my fav num is\", x, \".\", \"x =\", x)\\n\\tOutputs: \"my fav num is 1 . x = 1\" (spaces are automatically added between items).\\n\\tNo need to convert numbers to strings when using commas.\\n\\tUsing Concatenation with +:\\n\\tx_str = str(x)\\n\\tprint(\"my fav num is \" + x_str + \". \" + \"x = \" + x_str)\\n\\tOutputs: \"my fav num is 1. x = 1\" (no automatic spaces).\\n\\tNon-string values (e.g., x) must be explicitly converted to strings using str().\\n\\tDifferences Between Commas and Concatenation (+)\\n\\tCommas:\\n\\tAutomatically adds spaces between items.\\n\\tCan mix strings, numbers, and other types directly.\\n\\tConcatenation:\\n\\tRequires all items to be strings.\\n\\tProvides precise control over formatting (no automatic spaces).\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Lecture_Notes>\\n<Coverage>\\nSimilarity Score: 90%\\nSimilarities:\\nPurpose of print: Both the transcript and the lecture notes clearly explain that print is used to output information to the console.\\nCommas in print: Both sources emphasize that commas automatically insert spaces between items and allow mixed types (strings, numbers, etc.) without conversion.\\nConcatenation with +: Both explain that + requires explicit string conversion (e.g., str()) and provides precise formatting without adding spaces.\\nExample Outputs: Both include examples demonstrating how commas and concatenation work differently in print.\\n</Coverage> \\n<Missing_Points>\\nTranscript: Provides more detailed discussion and examples, such as:\\nCombining commas and concatenation within the same print statement.\\nSpecific mention of automatic spaces introduced by commas.\\nA demonstration in Spider (the transcript includes visual-based explanations missing from the notes).\\nLecture Notes: Shorter and more focused on concise examples, lacking nuanced details about combining different formatting methods or practical pitfalls.\\n</Missing_Points>\\n</Lecture_Segment>\\n<Lecture_Segment time= \"9:00-12:00\">\\n<Transcript>\\n\\t<Text>\\n\\tSo if I run this, notice this very first line added spaces everywhere in between all\\n\\tmy objects. The second one added spaces somewhere. And you can sort of trace through and\\n\\tsee exactly where the spaces were added. And the last line here didn\\'t add spaces anywhere.\\n\\tSo printing things out to the console is nice, but the second part of sort of writing an interactive\\n\\tprogram is getting input from the user. And that\\'s the more interesting part. So if you\\'ve done\\n\\tproblem set 0, you might have sort of already tried to understand this on your own. But here\\n\\twe are. So the way you get input from the user is using this command function called input.\\n\\tAnd inside the parentheses, you type in whatever you\\'d like to prompt the user with. So in this\\n\\tcase, in my example here, I have input, and then here I said \"type anything.\" So the user is\\n\\tgoing to see this text here, and then the program is just going to stop. And it\\'s going to wait for\\n\\tthe user to type in something and hit Enter. As soon as the user types in Enter, whatever the\\n\\tuser types in becomes a string. If a user types in a number, for example, that becomes the\\n\\tstring of that number. So everything the user types in is going to be made as a string.\\n\\tIn this line right here, whatever these the user types in becomes a string. And we\\'re going to\\n\\tbind that string object to this variable named text. So now, further in my program, I could do\\n\\twhatever I want with this variable text. In this case, I\\'m going to print 5*text. OK. So if the user,\\n\\tfor example, gave me \"ha,\" I\\'m going to print \"ha\" 5 times. If the user gave me 5, what do you\\n\\tthink the user is-- what do you think is going to be printed out? 25 or 5 five times? Great. Yes.\\n\\tExactly. 5 five times. Oftentimes, you don\\'t want to work with numbers as strings, right? You want to work with\\n\\tnumbers as numbers, right? So you have to cast. And we learned that last lecture. You cast by\\n\\tjust putting in this little bit right in front of the input. And you can cast it to whatever type you\\n\\twant. Here I cast it to an int, but you can also cast to a float if you want to work with floats. And\\n\\tthat converts whatever the user typed in, as long as it\\'s some number that Python knows how\\n\\tto convert, into the number itself. So in this case, if the user gives me 5, I\\'m going to print out 5\\n\\ttimes 5 instead of 5 five times.

And\\n\\tthen when I type in the number, since I\\'m casting it, I\\'m going to do operations with the\\n\\tnumber. Yeah, question.\\n\\tAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\\n\\tPROFESSOR: Why do you want to cast to-- oh. The question is why do you want to cast to a string? Why do\\n\\tyou want to cast a string to a number?\\n\\tAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\\n\\tPROFESSOR: Oh, so Python always-- whatever you type in, just by default, by definition of the input\\n\\tcommand, Python always makes it a string. So if you want to work with numbers, you have to\\n\\texplicitly tell it, I\\'m going to work with a number. So even if you give it the number 5, it\\'s going\\n\\tto think it\\'s the string 5. Yeah. That\\'s just how input works.\\n\\tThe next thing we\\'re going to look at is ways that you can start adding tests in your code. And\\n\\tbefore you can start adding tests in your code, you need to be able to do the actual tests. So\\n\\tthis is where comparison operators come in. So here, let\\'s assume that i and j are variables.\\n\\tThe following comparisons are going to give you a Boolean. So it\\'s either going to say, this is\\n\\ttrue or this is false. So that\\'s going to be your test.\\n\\tSo if i and j are variables, you\\'re allowed to compare ints with ints, floats with floats, strings\\n\\twith strings. And you\\'re allowed to compare ints and floats between themselves, but you\\'re not\\n\\tallowed to compare a string with a number. In fact, if you even try to do that in Python-- in\\n\\tSpider here, if I try to say, is the letter a greater than 5? I get some angry text right here. And\\n\\tthis just tells me Python doesn\\'t understand the meaning of-- how do I compare a string with a\\n\\tnumber?\\n\\tOK. So just like in math, we can do these usual comparisons. We can say if something is\\n\\tgreater than something, greater or equal to, less than, less than or equal to. I\\'d like to bring to\\n\\tyour attention the equality. So the single equals sign is an assignment. So you\\'re taking a\\n\\tvalue, and you\\'re assigning it to a variable. But when you\\'re doing the double equals sign, this\\n\\tis the test for equality. Is the value of variable i the same as the value of the variable j? And\\n\\tthat\\'s, again, also going to give you a Boolean either true or false\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tCasting with input():\\n\\tBy default, Python treats all input as a string.\\n\\tTo perform operations with numbers, you must explicitly cast the string input to a numeric type (e.g., int or float).\\n\\tExample: \"5\" is treated as a string, not the number 5, unless cast explicitly.\\n\\tWhy Cast?\\n\\tPython\\'s input() function always converts user input to a string.\\n\\tCasting is necessary when working with numeric input to ensure proper arithmetic or logical operations.\\n\\tIntroduction to Tests:\\n\\tTesting conditions in code requires using comparison operators to generate Boolean values (True or False).\\n\\tComparison Rules:\\n\\tComparisons are valid for:\\n\\tSame data types (e.g., int-to-int, float-to-float, string-to-string).\\n\\tIntegers and floats (cross-type comparison is allowed between these).\\n\\tComparisons between strings and numbers are not allowed, and Python will throw an error (e.g., \"a\" > 5).\\n\\tComparison Operators:\\n\\tStandard comparison operators:\\n\\tGreater than, Less than.\\n\\tGreater than or equal to, Less than or equal to.\\n\\tEquality (==): Tests if two values are the same.\\n\\tDistinction between = and ==:\\n\\t= is used for assignment.\\n\\t== is used to test equality.\\n\\tTesting Output:\\n\\tResults of comparisons yield Boolean values (True or False), enabling their use in conditional statements or logical evaluations.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Transcript>\\n<Lecture_Notes>\\n\\t<Text>\\t\\n\\tCOMPARISON OPERATORS ON\\n\\tint, float, string\\n\\t- i and j are variable names\\n\\t- comparisons below evaluate to a Boolean\\n\\ti greater than j\\n\\ti greater than or equal to j\\n\\ti less than j\\n\\ti less than or equal j\\n\\ti == j - equality test, True if i is the same as j\\n\\ti != j - inequality test, True if i not the same as j\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tComparison Operators:\\n\\tUsed to compare values and evaluate to a Boolean (True or False).\\n\\tValid Comparisons:\\n\\tComparisons are allowed between variables of:\\n\\tSame types (e.g., int-to-int, float-to-float, string-to-string).\\n\\tIntegers and floats (cross-type comparisons are valid).\\n\\tOperator Descriptions:\\n\\ti > j: True if i is greater than j.\\n\\ti >= j: True if i is greater than or equal to j.\\n\\ti < j: True if i is less than j.\\n\\ti <= j: True if i is less than or equal to j.\\n\\ti == j: Equality test.

So those are comparison operators on integer, floats, and strings. On Booleans, you can\\n\\tdo some logic operators. And the simplest is just inverting. So if a is a variable that has a\\n\\tBoolean value, not a is just going to invert it. So if a is true, then not a is false, and vice versa.\\n\\tThis is a table that sort of represents what I\\'ve said here. So you can do-- you can use and\\n\\tand or. These are key words in Python. You can use those two key words on variables, on\\n\\tBoolean variables. And you get the result a and b is only true if both a and b are true. And a or\\n\\tb is only false if a and b are false. And this is the complete table just in case you need to\\n\\treference it.\\n\\tAll right. So now that we have ways to do logical-- question right there.\\n\\tAUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\\n\\tPROFESSOR: Yeah, great question. So what does it mean to compare a string with a string with the greater\\n\\tthan? So that\\'s just going to compare them, lexicographically. So does it come first in the\\n\\talphabet? So we can even test that out. We can say, is a greater than b? And it\\'s false. So b\\n\\tcomes later in the alphabet than a.\\n\\tOK. So now we have ways to do the tests. So we can add some branching to our\\n\\tprogramming toolbox now that we have ways to do tests. This is a map of MIT. I\\'m going to go\\n\\tthrough sort of a little example to motivate why we would want to do branching in our code.\\n\\tAnd I think after this lecture, you\\'ll be able to sort of code up this algorithm that I\\'m going to\\n\\texplain. So most of us see MIT as a maze. I first did when I came here. When I first came\\n\\there, obviously, I signed up for the free food mailing list. And MIT, being a maze, I had no idea\\n\\twhere to go, what the shortest path was to free food. So one way to think about it is all I\\n\\twanted to do was get to the free food. A very simple algorithm to get there would be to say, OK, I\\'m going take my right hand, and\\n\\tI\\'m going to make sure that my right hand is always on a wall. And I\\'m going to go around\\n\\tcampus with my right hand always being at a wall.

If my\\n\\tright hand always has to be on a wall, then I\\'m going to say, if there\\'s no wall to my right side,\\n\\tthen I\\'m going to go right until I get to a wall. Then if there\\'s a wall to my right, and I can go\\n\\tforward, I\\'m just going to keep going forward. If I keep going forward, and there\\'s a wall to my\\n\\tright and in front of me, I\\'m going to turn around and go left. And then if there\\'s a wall to my\\n\\tright, in front of me, and to the left, then I\\'m going to turn around and go back.\\n\\tSo with this fairly simple algorithm, I just follow the path always keeping the wall to my right.\\n\\tAnd eventually, I would end up where I need to be. So notice, I used, just in plain English, a\\n\\tfew key words. If, otherwise, things like that. So in programming, we have those same\\n\\tconstructs. And those same sort of intuitive words can be used to tell Python to do something\\n\\tor to do something else or to choose from a different set of possibilities. And this way, we can\\n\\tget the computer to make decisions for us. And you might be thinking, well, you said that\\n\\tcomputers can\\'t make decisions on their own. It\\'s not. You, as programmers, are going to\\n\\tbuild these decisions into the program, and all the computer is going to do is going to reach\\n\\tthe decision point and say, OK, this is a decision point, should I go left or should I go right? Or\\n\\twhich one do I pick? And these sort of decisions are created by you as a programmer. And the\\n\\tcomputer just has to make the decision and choose a path.\\n\\tOK. So in programming, there\\'s three sort of simple ways that you can add control flow to your\\n\\tprograms. And that\\'s making one decision and choosing whether to execute something or\\n\\texecute something else. The first is a simple if. And given a program that just linearly has\\n\\tstatements that get executed, whenever I reach an if statement, you\\'re going to check the\\n\\tcondition. The condition is going to be something that\\'s going to get evaluated to either true or\\n\\tfalse.\\n\\tSo I\\'ve reached the condition here. And if the condition is true, then I\\'m going to additionally\\n\\texecute this extra set of expressions. But if the condition is false, then I\\'m just going to keep\\n\\tgoing through the program and not execute that extra set of instructions. How does Python\\n\\tknow which instructions to execute? They\\'re going to be inside this what we call code block.\\n\\tAnd the code block is denoted by indentation. So it\\'s going to be everything that\\'s indented is\\n\\tpart of that if code block.

So that\\'s how you write code that decides whether to execute this extra thing or not. Now\\n\\tlet\\'s say I don\\'t just want to execute an extra thing, I want to reach a point where I say, I\\'ll\\n\\teither go down this path or I\\'ll do something else. That\\'s this right here. So this if else construct\\n\\tsays this is my code, I\\'ve reached my decision point here, if the condition inside the if is true,\\n\\tthen I\\'m going to execute maybe this set of statements here. But if the condition is not true,\\n\\tthen I\\'m not going to execute that set of statements, and instead I\\'m going to execute under\\n\\twhatever else is. So using this construct, I\\'m either going to do one set of expressions or the\\n\\tother, but never both. And after I\\'ve executed one or the other, I\\'m going to continue on with\\n\\tjust the regular execution of the program.\\n\\tOK. So we\\'re able to either choose one thing, choose one thing or another, but what if we\\n\\twant to have more than one choice? So if some number is equal to zero, I want to do this. If\\n\\tit\\'s equal to 1, I want to do this. If it\\'s equal to 2, I want to do this, and so on. That\\'s where this\\n\\tlast one comes in. And we introduced this other key word here called elif. So that stands for\\n\\tshort form for else if. So first we check if this condition is true. So we\\'re going through our\\n\\tprogram, we\\'ve reached our decision point, if the condition is true, we\\'re going to execute\\n\\tmaybe this set of instructions. If the condition is not true, maybe we\\'ll check-- if the condition is\\n\\tnot true, we will check this next condition. That\\'s part of the elif right here. And if that one\\'s\\n\\ttrue, we\\'re going to execute a different set of instructions. You can have more than one elif.\\n\\tAnd depending on which one\\'s true, you\\'re going to execute a different set of instructions. And\\n\\tthen this last else is sort of a catch all where if none of the previous conditions were true, then\\n\\tjust do this last set of expressions.\\n\\tSo in this case, you\\'re going to choose between one of these three-- one of these four roots,\\n\\tor however many you have. And then when you\\'re done making your choice, you\\'re going to\\n\\texecute the remaining set of instructions. So the way this works is if more than one condition is\\n\\ttrue, you\\'re actually just going to enter one of them. And you\\'re going to enter the very first\\n\\tone that\\'s true. So you\\'re never going to enter more than one of these code blocks.

And that\\'s actually one of the things\\n\\tthat I really like about Python. It sort of forces you to write pretty code and nice looking code\\n\\tand just code that\\'s very readable. And that forces you to indent everything that\\'s a code\\n\\tblock. So you can easily see sort of where the flow of control is and where decision making\\n\\tpoints are and things like that. So in this particular example, we have one if statement here,\\n\\tand it checks if two variables are equal. And we have an if, elif, else. And in this example,\\n\\twe\\'re going to enter either this code block or this one or this one, depending on the variables\\n\\tof x and y. And we\\'re only going into one code block. And we\\'ll enter the first one that\\'s true.\\n\\tNotice you can have nested conditionals. So inside this first if, we have another if here. And\\n\\tthis inner if is only going to be checked when we enter the first-- this outter if. I do want to\\n\\tmake one point, though. So sometimes, you might forget to do the double equals sign when\\n\\tyou are checking for equality, and that\\'s OK. If you just use one equals sign, Python\\'s going to\\n\\tgive you an error. And it\\'s going to say syntax error, and it\\'s going to highlight this line. And\\n\\tthen you\\'re going to know that there\\'s a mistake there. And you should be using equality,\\n\\tbecause it doesn\\'t make sense to be using-- to assign-- to be making an assignment inside\\n\\tthe if.\\n\\tSo we\\'ve learned about branching. And we know about conditionals. Let\\'s try to apply this to a\\n\\tlittle game. And spoiler, we won\\'t be able to. We\\'ll have to learn about a new thing. But back in\\n\\tthe 1980s, there was the Legend of Zelda-- cool graphics-- where there was a scene with the\\n\\tlost woods. Oversimplification if anyone\\'s a Zelda die hard fan.

And the trick was you just had\\n\\tto go backward, and then you\\'d exit the woods.

And we\\'d say something like this. If\\n\\tthe user exits right, then set the background to the woods background. Otherwise, set the\\n\\tbackground to the exit background. Now let\\'s say the user-- and then in the else, we\\'re done.\\n\\tLet\\'s say the user went right. Well, you\\'d show them the woods background, and now ask\\n\\tthem again, where do they want to go? If they exit right, set the background to the woods\\n\\tbackground. Otherwise, set the background to the exit background, and so on.\\n\\tSo you notice that there\\'s sort of no end to this, right? How many times-- do you know how\\n\\tmany times the user might keep going right? They might be really persistent, right? And they\\'ll\\n\\tbe like maybe if I go 1,000 times, I\\'ll get out of the woods. Maybe 1,001? Maybe. So this would\\n\\tprobably be-- who knows how deep? These nested ifs. So we don\\'t know. So with what we\\n\\tknow so far, we can\\'t really code this cute little game.\\n\\tBut enter loops. And specifically, a while loop. So this code here that could be infinitely number\\n\\tof nested if statements deep can be rewritten using these three lines. So we say while the user\\n\\texits right, set the background to the woods background. And with a while loop, it\\'s going to do\\n\\twhat we tell it to do inside the loop, and then it\\'s going to check the condition again, and then\\n\\tit\\'s going to do what we say it should do inside the code block, and it\\'s going to check the\\n\\tcondition again. And then when the condition-- as long as a condition is true, it\\'s going to keep\\n\\tdoing that little loop there. And as soon as the condition becomes false, it\\'s going to stop doing\\n\\tthe loop and do whatever\\'s right after the while.\\n\\tOK. So that\\'s basically how a while loop works. We have while. That\\'s the key word. The\\n\\tcondition is something that gets evaluated to true or false. And once again, we have a code\\n\\tblock that\\'s indented, and it tells Python, these are the expressions I want to do as long as the\\n\\tcondition is true. So the condition is true, you evaluate every expression in the code block.\\n\\tWhen you reach the end of the expression-- end of the code block, you check the condition\\n\\tagain. If it\\'s true still, you keep doing the expressions. Check it again, and so on.\\n\\tSo here\\'s a little game. And with these lines of code, we were able-- we can code up the lost\\n\\twoods of Zelda. Even worse graphics, by the way than the original Zelda is this one that I\\n\\tcoded up here. So I print out the following things. \"You\\'re in the Lost Forest. Go left or right.\"\\n\\tAnd my program\\'s going to say, \"You\\'re in the Lost Forest.

So I\\'m asking them again by just saying input here again. And that\\'s it. That\\'s\\n\\tgoing to just keep getting input from the user. And if the user doesn\\'t type in right, and maybe\\n\\ttypes in left, you\\'re going to exit out of this loop, and print out, \"You\\'ve got out of the Lost\\n\\tForest.\"\\n\\tSo I have to show you this, because I spent too much time on it. But I decided to improve on\\n\\tthe code that\\'s in the slides. And I\\'ve written here ways that you guys can also improve it. So if\\n\\tI run my code-- \"You\\'re in the Lost Forest. Go left or right.\" So if I say left, then yay, I got out of\\n\\tthe Lost Forest. But if I go right, then I\\'m stuck, right? I took down some trees. You can see\\n\\tthere\\'s no more trees here. I made a table, and then I flipped it over.\\n\\tSo the expansion to this if you want to try it out-- I put this in the comments here-- is try to use\\n\\ta counter. If the user types in right the first two times, just make that a sad face. But if the user\\n\\ttypes in more than two times, make them cut down some trees and build a table and flip it.\\n\\tThat\\'s a cute little expansion if you want to test yourself to make sure you are getting loops.\\n\\tOK. So so far, we\\'ve used while loops to ask for user input. And that\\'s actually somewhere\\n\\twhere it makes sense to use while loops, because you don\\'t actually know how many times\\n\\tthe user is going to type in something. You can use while loops to keep sort of a counter and\\n\\tto write code that counts something. If you do that, though, there\\'s two things you need to take\\n\\tcare of. The first is the first line here, which is sort of an initialization of this loop counter. And\\n\\tthe second is this line here, which is incrementing your loop counter.\\n\\tThe reason why the second one is important is because-- let\\'s look at our condition here. So\\n\\twhile n is less than five. If you didn\\'t have this line here, you would never increment n. So\\n\\tevery time through the loop, you just keep printing zeros. And you would have an infinite loop.\\n\\tI do want to show, though, what-- if you do have an infinite loop, it\\'s not the end of the world.\\n\\tSo I can say something like-- so while true, print zero. So this is going to give me an infinite\\n\\tloop in my program. And-- whoop. OK. So notice it\\'s just printing the letter p over and over\\n\\tagain. And if I let it go any longer, it\\'s going to slow down the computer. So I\\'m going to hit\\n\\tControl-C or Command-C maybe. And it\\'s going to stop the program from printing. So just in\\n\\tcase you ever enter infinite loops in your programs, just go to the console and hit Control-C,\\n\\tand that\\'s going to stop it from sort of slowing down the computer.\\n\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tLost Woods Example:\\n\\tA while loop keeps asking the user to input \"right\" or \"left.\"\\n\\tIf the user types \"right,\" the program displays the same text and continues looping.\\n\\tTyping \"left\" exits the loop and prints, \"You\\'ve got out of the Lost Forest.\"\\n\\tImproved Example:\\n\\tEnhancements to the code include adding a counter for user inputs:\\n\\tFirst two \"right\" inputs display a sad face.\\n\\tAfter more than two \"right\" inputs, the user metaphorically \"cuts down trees and builds a table.\"\\n\\tPurpose of while Loops:\\n\\tUseful for scenarios where the number of iterations is unknown, like waiting for specific user input.\\n\\tCan also keep a counter or count something during iterations.\\n\\tLoop Counter:\\n\\tInitialization: The counter variable must be initialized before the loop starts.\\n\\tIncrementing: Failing to increment the counter inside the loop can lead to an infinite loop.\\n\\tInfinite Loops:\\n\\tExample of an infinite loop: while True: print(0).\\n\\tInfinite loops slow down the computer but can be stopped by pressing Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C on Mac) in the console.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n\\n</Transcript>\\n<Lecture_Notes>\\n\\t<Text>\\t\\n\\tCONTROL FLOW:\\n\\twhile and for LOOPS\\n\\t- iterate through numbers in a sequence\\n\\t# more complicated with while loop\\n\\tn = 0\\n\\twhile n < 5:\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t\\tn = n+1\\n\\t# shortcut with for loop\\n\\tfor n in range(5):\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tControl Flow with Loops:\\n\\tLoops allow iteration through sequences or repeated execution of code.\\n\\twhile Loop Example:\\n\\tPurpose: Repeatedly executes code while a condition remains true.\\n\\tExample:\\n\\tn = 0\\n\\twhile n < 5:\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t\\tn = n + 1\\n\\tSteps:\\n\\tInitialize the counter variable (n = 0).\\n\\tCheck the condition (n < 5).\\n\\tExecute the block of code inside the loop.\\n\\tIncrement the counter (n = n + 1).\\n\\tfor Loop Example:\\n\\tPurpose: Provides a more concise way to iterate through sequences.\\n\\tfor n in range(5):\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\tRange Function: Automatically generates numbers from 0 to 4 (not inclusive of 5).\\n\\tEliminates the need for manual initialization and incrementation.\\n\\tComparison:\\n\\twhile Loop: Offers flexibility but requires more explicit handling (e.g., counter initialization and incrementing).\\n\\tfor Loop: Provides a shortcut and is more concise for sequences or ranges.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Lecture_Notes>\\n<Coverage>\\nSimilarity: The lecture slides and transcript cover similar ground regarding loops, focusing on the concepts of while loops and for loops.

These details are not present in the slides.\\nThe transcript briefly mentions enhancing user interaction (e.g., using a counter or handling user input creatively), which is not in the slides.\\n</Missing_Points>\\n</Lecture_Segment>\\n<Lecture_Segment time= \"33:00-36:00\">\\n<Transcript>\\n\\t<Text>\\n\\tOK. So going back to this example, I was saying that if you\\'re using counters-- variables in\\n\\torder to sort of count up inside the while loop, you have to take care to initialize a counter\\n\\tvariable first. And then to increment it, otherwise you\\'ll enter an infinite loop. That feels a little\\n\\tbit tedious. And so there\\'s a shortcut for doing that exact same thing.\\n\\tSo these four lines, you can rewrite those into these two lines right here using this new type of\\n\\tloop called a for loop. So the for loop says, for some loop variable-- in this case, I named it n.\\n\\tYou can name it whatever you want. In range 5-- we\\'re going to come back to what range\\n\\tmeans in a little bit-- print n. So every time through the loop, you\\'re going to print out what the\\n\\tvalue of n is. Range 5 actually creates internally a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and\\n\\tgoing to that number 5 minus 1.\\n\\tSo the sequence is going to be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The first time through the loop, you\\'re going\\n\\tto say n is equal to 0. Or internally, this is what happens. N gets the value of 0. You\\'re going to\\n\\tprint n. Then you\\'re going to go back to the top. N gets the value 1. Then you\\'re going to go\\n\\texecute whatever is inside. So you\\'re going to print 1. Then you\\'re going to increment that to\\n\\tthe next value in the sequence. You\\'re going to print out 2, and so on.\\n\\tSo this is the general look of a for loop. So we have for some loop variable-- again, can be\\n\\tnamed whatever you want-- in range some number. Do a bunch of stuff. And again, these are\\n\\tpart of this for loop code block. So you should indent them to tell Python that these are the\\n\\tthings that you should do. So when you\\'re using range some number, you start out with\\n\\tvariable getting the value 0. With variable having value 0, you\\'re going to execute all of these\\n\\texpressions. After all the expressions in the code block are done, you\\'re going to go on to the\\n\\tnext value. So 1. You\\'re going to execute all these expressions with the variable being value 1,\\n\\tand then so on and so on until you go to some num minus 1.\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tCounter Initialization in While Loops:\\n\\tIt\\'s important to initialize a counter variable before using it in a while loop.\\n\\tThe counter must be incremented to avoid entering an infinite loop.\\n\\tUsing For Loops as a Shortcut:\\n\\tA for loop provides a shortcut to avoid manually initializing and incrementing a counter.\\n\\tInstead of writing multiple lines of code, a for loop allows iteration through a sequence in a more concise way.\\n\\tFor Loop Structure:\\n\\tSyntax: for variable in range(number): — the loop runs for a sequence of values starting from 0 up to number-1.\\n\\tThe loop variable (e.g., n) takes on values from the sequence created by range().\\n\\tIndentation is used to denote the code block to be executed within the loop.\\n\\tUnderstanding range():\\n\\trange(5) generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at 4 (5 minus 1).\\n\\tIn each iteration, the loop variable takes a value from the sequence, and the code block is executed for that value.\\n\\tExample Execution:\\n\\tThe for loop will print the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as it iterates through the range.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Transcript>\\n<Lecture_Notes>\\n\\t<Text>\\t\\n\\tCONTROL FLOW:\\n\\twhile and for LOOPS\\n\\t- iterate through numbers in a sequence\\n\\t# more complicated with while loop\\n\\tn = 0\\n\\twhile n < 5:\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t\\tn = n+1\\n\\t# shortcut with for loop\\n\\tfor n in range(5):\\n\\t\\tprint(n)\\n\\t\\tCONTROL FLOW: for LOOPS\\n\\tfor <variable> in range(<some_num>):\\n\\t\\t<expression>\\n\\t\\t<expression>\\n\\t- each time through the loop, <variable> takes a value\\n\\t- first time, <variable> starts at the smallest value\\n\\t- next time, <variable> gets the prev value + 1\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\tWhile and For Loops:\\n\\tBoth while and for loops are used to iterate through numbers in a sequence.\\n\\twhile loops can be more complicated because you need to manually manage the loop counter (e.g., initialization and increment\\n\\tThe while loop requires explicit counter management (n = n + 1), which can be cumbersome.\\n\\tA for loop provides a simplified method for iteration, automatically managing the loop variable.\\n\\tThe for loop simplifies the syntax and automatically handles the counter, eliminating the need for explicit increments.\\n\\tFor Loop Structure:\\n\\tfor <variable> in range(<some_num>):\\n\\t\\t<expression>\\n\\tThe loop variable (e.g., <variable>) takes a value from a sequence created by range().\\n\\tFirst Iteration: The loop variable starts at the smallest value (0).\\n\\tSubsequent Iterations: The variable increments by 1 (starting from 0 to some_num - 1).\\n\\tKey Point on Loop Variable:\\n\\tEach time through the loop, the loop variable takes a value from the range, starting at the smallest value and increasing by 1 on each iteration.\\n\\t</Key_points>\\n</Lecture_Notes>\\n<Coverage>\\nOn a scale of 0-100%, the similarity between the transcript and the lecture notes is about 90%.

Sometimes you might want to write programs that maybe start at a custom value. Don\\'t\\n\\tstart at 0. Maybe they start at 5. Maybe they start at minus 10. And sometimes you might want\\n\\tto write programs that don\\'t go with-- don\\'t expect the numbers by 1, but maybe skip every\\n\\tother number, go every two numbers, or every three numbers, and so on.\\n\\tSo you can customize range to your needs. The one thing you do need to give it is the stop.\\n\\tSo if you give it only one value in the parentheses that stands for stop. And by default, start is\\n\\tgoing to have the value 0, and step is going to have the value 1. If you give it two things in the\\n\\tparentheses, you\\'re giving it start and stop. So the first being start, the second being stop. And\\n\\tstep gets this value of 1 by default. And if you give it three things in the parentheses, you\\'re\\n\\tgiving it start, stop, and step in that order. And you\\'re always going to start at the start value\\n\\tand stop at-- or so you\\'re going to start at the start value, and you\\'re going to go until stop\\n\\tminus 1. So those are the sequences of numbers.\\n\\tSo in this first code right here, my sum is going to get the value 0. And you\\'re going to have a\\n\\tfor loop. We\\'re going to start from 7, because we\\'re giving it two numbers. And when you give\\n\\tit two numbers, it represents start and stop with step being 1. So we\\'re starting at 7. If step is\\n\\t1, the next value is 8. What\\'s the value after that? If we\\'re incrementing by 1? 9. And since\\n\\twe\\'re going until stop minus 1, we\\'re not actually going to pick up on 10. So this loop variable,\\n\\ti, the very first time through the loop is going to have the value 7. So my sum is going to be 0\\n\\tplus 7. That\\'s everything that\\'s inside the code block.\\n\\tThe next time through the loop, i gets the value 8. So inside the for loop, my sum gets\\n\\twhatever the previous value was, which was 7, plus 8. OK. The next time through the loop, my\\n\\tsum get the value 7 plus 8 plus 9.

That\\'s a great question. We can try that out. I\\'m not actually sure\\n\\tright off the top of my head. So you can go on Spider and say-- let\\'s say in this example here.\\n\\tSo we can say 7.1, 10.3-- yeah. So they have to be integers. OK. So that\\'s that example. And\\n\\tlet\\'s erase that. In this particular example, we have start, stop, and step. And here, we\\'re going\\n\\tevery other value. So we\\'re starting at 5. Tell me what the next value is supposed to be. If\\n\\twe\\'re taking every other one. 7, and then 9, and then-- are we doing 11 or not? Excellent.\\n\\tNice. Yeah. So we\\'re going to the end minus 1. OK.\\n\\tSo it\\'s possible that sometimes you write code where you might want to exit out of the loop\\n\\tearly. You don\\'t want to go through all of the sequences of your numbers. Maybe there\\'s a\\n\\tcondition inside there where you just want to exit the loop early. Inside the while loop, maybe\\n\\tyou want to exit the loop before the condition becomes false. So that\\'s where the break\\n\\tstatement comes in. So the break works like this. It\\'s going to-- as soon as Python sees this\\n\\tbreak statement, it\\'s going to say, OK, I\\'m going to look at whatever loop I\\'m currently in. I\\'m\\n\\tnot evaluating any expression after it that comes within my loop. And I\\'m going to immediately\\n\\texit the loop. So I\\'m going inside this while, this while, I\\'m evaluating this one expression, and I\\n\\tsuddenly see a break.\\n\\tExpression b does not get evaluated. And break is going to immediately exit out of the\\n\\tinnermost loop that it\\'s in. So this while loop that has condition 2, that\\'s the innermost loop that\\n\\tthe break is found in. So we\\'re going to exit out of this inner most loop here. And we\\'re\\n\\tevaluating expression c. And notice, we\\'re evaluating expression c, because it\\'s-- expression c\\n\\tis part of the outer while loop. It\\'s at the same level as this one. And these ones are part of the\\n\\tinner while loop.\\n\\tOK. Last thing I want to say is just a little bit of a comparison between for and while loops. So\\n\\twhen would you use one or the other. This might be useful in your problem sets. So for loops\\n\\tyou usually use when you know the number of iterations. While loops are very useful when, for\\n\\texample, you\\'re getting user input, and user input is unpredictable. You don\\'t know how many\\n\\ttimes they\\'re going to do a certain task. For both for and while loops, you can end out of the\\n\\tloop early using the break. The for loop uses this counter. It\\'s inherent inside the for loop. A\\n\\twhile loop you can use a counter in order-- you can use a while loop to count things. But you\\n\\tmust initialize the counter before the while loop. And you have to remember to increment it\\n\\twithin the loop. Otherwise, you maybe lead to an infinite loop. We\\'ve seen as the very first\\n\\texample of a for loop that the while-- the for loop could be rewritten as a while loop, but the\\n\\tvice versa is not necessarily true. And the counterexample to that is just user input. So you\\n\\tmight not know how many times you might do a certain task. All right. Great. That\\'s all for\\n\\ttoday.\\n\\t</Text>\\n\\t<Key_points>\\n\\t1. range() and Integers:\\n\\trange() requires integers for its arguments (start, stop, step); floating-point numbers are not allowed.\\n\\tExample: range(7.1, 10.3) is invalid.\\n\\t2. Behavior of range():\\n\\tWhen using range(start, stop, step), the loop iterates over values starting at start, incrementing by step, and stopping before stop - 1.\\n\\tExample given: Starting at 5 with a step of 2 results in 5, 7, 9, but not 11.\\n\\t3. Exiting Loops Early with break:\\n\\tThe break statement allows exiting a loop immediately, regardless of the remaining conditions or iterations.\\n\\tBehavior:\\n\\tSkips evaluating any remaining expressions in the current (innermost) loop.\\n\\tExecution resumes outside the loop.\\n\\t4.

It doesn't take in the parameters, it just prints out this message\\n    here. And then it leaves; it's done. There's no return, so we return None. So func_a returns\\n    None to whoever called it, which was that line there, so that is going to be None.\\n    Next line. This one right here-- print 5 plus some function call. Again I'm going to hop into\\n    func_b's scope and see what to do there. So first I'm going to map my parameters. So 2--\\n    whoops-- 2 gets mapped to y. So inside func_b's scope, y is going to get the value 2.\\n    That's the very first thing I'm doing-- mapping all the parameters. Then I'm going to print this\\n    thing here, and then I'm going to return y. So inside func_b, y has the value 2, and I'm\\n    returning 2 back to whoever called me. So this is the value 2 and I'm going to print 5 plus 2,\\n    which is 7.\\n    Last one. This is the trickiest. Oop, that popped up. If you think you've got it, try that exercise.\\n    But otherwise follow along. print func_c func_a. So I see that I am going to enter func_c's\\n    scope. So I'm going to look at what func_c does.\\n    First thing I do is I'm mapping all the parameters. Don't even worry about the fact that this is a\\n    function right now. Just pretend it's x or something. So you say func_a is going to get mapped\\n    to the variable z inside func_c. So z is func_c. Just mapping parameters from actual to formal.\\n    Then what do we do inside func_c? We print out inside func_c, and then we return z. This is\\n    the cool part. Inside func_c, z is func_a. So if you replace z with func_a, this here becomes\\n    return func_a open close parentheses. Look familiar? We did that function call right there\\n    right? So that's just another function call.\\n    So with that being another function call, you're going to create another scope, and you're\\n    going to pop into that one. So we're one, two, I guess two scopes deep, and we're trying to\\n    figure out where we're going.
