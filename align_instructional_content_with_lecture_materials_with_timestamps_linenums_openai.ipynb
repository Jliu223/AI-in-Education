of an algorithm\\n0:41 as the size of the input grows?\\n0:43 And as I've said several times, I'll\\n0:44 say at least once more, how do we also\\n0:46 turn it the other direction?\\n0:47 How do we use thoughts about choices of pieces of algorithm\\n0:52 in terms of implications on the cost\\n0:54 it's going to take us to compute?\\n0:56 We saw last time a set of examples-- constant algorithms,\\n1:01 linear algorithms, logarithmic algorithms, linear algorithms,\\n1:06 quadratic algorithms, exponential algorithms.\\n1:09 Today, what I'm going to do is fill\\n1:11 in one more piece, a log linear algorithm-- something that's\\n1:14 really a nice kind of algorithm to have-- and use it to talk\\n1:18 about one last class of algorithms that\\n1:20 are really valuable, and those are searching and sorting\\n1:23 algorithms.\\n1:25 So a search algorithm.\\n1:27 Kind of an obvious statement.\\n1:29 You use them all the time when you go to Google or Bing\\n1:31 or whatever your favorite search mechanism on the web is.\\n1:35 It's just a way to find an item or a group of items\\n1:39 from a collection.\\n1:41 If you think about it, that collection\\n1:43 could be either implicit or explicit.\\n1:47 So way back at the beginning of the term,\\n1:48 we saw an example of a search algorithm\\n1:50 when you were looking for square roots.\\n1:53 And we saw simple things like exhaustive enumeration.\\n1:56 We'd go through all the possibilities.\\n1:58 We saw our first version of bisection search\\n2:00 there, where you would do approximations.\\n2:02 Newton-Raphson-- these are all examples of a search algorithm\\n2:05 where the collection is implicit.\\n2:08 So all the numbers between some point that some other point.\\n2:11 More common is a search algorithm\\n2:13 where the collection is explicit.\\n2:16 I don't know.\\n2:16 For example, I've got all the data records of students\\n2:19 and I want to know how do I find a particular student,\\n2:22 so I can record that A plus that everybody in this room\\n2:24 is going to get next Tuesday on that exam?\\n2:27 That's not a promise.\\n2:28 Sorry.\\n2:29 But we'll work on it.\\n2:30 So could do it implicit, could do it explicit.\\n2:33 Today I want to focus on doing search explicitly.\\n2:36 And it could be on different kinds of collections,\\n2:39 but I'm going to focus-- just as an example-- on search\\n2:41 over lists.\\n2:42 And to make it a little easier, let's just do search\\n2:45 over lists of numbers.\\n2:46 But it could obviously be other kinds of elements.\\n2:49 Now you've already seen some of this, right?\\n2:51 We did search where we said, we can do linear search.\\n2:54 Brute force.\\n2:55 Just walk down the list looking at everything\\n2:57 till we either find the thing we're looking for\\n3:00 or we get to the end of the list.\",\n          \"3:02 Sometimes also called British Museum algorithm\\n3:04 or exhaustive enumeration.\\n3:05 I go through everything in the list.\\n3:07 Nice news is, the list doesn't have to be sorted.\\n3:10 It could be just in arbitrary order.\\n3:12 What we saw is that the expected-- sorry, not expected.\\n3:16 The worst case behavior is linear.\\n3:18 In the worst case, the element's not in the list.\\n3:20 I got to look at everything.\\n3:21 So it's going to be linear in terms of complexity.\\n3:24 And then we looked at bisection search,\\n3:26 where we said the list needs to be sorted.\\n3:29 But if it is, we can actually be much more efficient\\n3:32 because we can take advantage of the sorting to cut down\\n3:36 the size of the problem.\\n3:38 And I'll remind you about both of those.\\n3:39 There was our simple little linear search.\\n3:42 Right?\\n3:42 Set a flag that says, I haven't yet found it.\\n3:45 And then just loop over the indices into the list.\\n3:48 I could have also just looped directly over the list\\n3:50 itself, checking to see if the ith member of the list\\n3:53 is the thing I'm looking for.\\n3:55 If it is, change the flag to true\\n3:57 so that when I come out of all of this\\n3:59 I'll return the flag-- either false because it\\n4:01 was set that way initially or true because I found it.\\n4:03 And of course what we knew is we have to look at everything\\n4:06 to see if it's there or not.\\n4:08 I could speed this up by just returning true at this point.\\n4:12 While that would improve the average case,\\n4:15 doesn't improve the worst case.\\n4:17 And that's the thing we usually are concerned about,\\n4:18 because in the worst case I've got to go through everything.\\n4:21 And just to remind you, we said this\\n4:22 is order length of the list.\\n4:24 To go around this part-- the loop right\\n4:26 here-- and inside the loop, it's constant work.\\n4:30 I'm doing the same number of things each time.\\n4:32 That's order n times order 1.\\n4:35 And by our rules, that's just order n.\\n4:36 So it's linear in the size of the problem.\\n4:41 OK.\\n4:42 We said we could do it on sorted lists.\\n4:45 But just again, we'll walk down the list.\\n4:47 Again, here I could loop over everything in the list,\\n4:50 checking to see if it's the thing I want.\\n4:52 Return true.\\n4:53 And if I ever get to a point where the element of the list\\n4:56 is bigger than the thing I'm looking for,\\n4:59 I know it can't be in the rest of the list\\n5:01 because all the things to the right are bigger yet.\\n5:03 I could just Return false and drop out.\\n5:06 In terms of average behavior, this\\n5:08 is better because it's going to stop\\n5:10 as soon as it gets to a point where it\\n5:11 can rule everything else out.\\n5:14 But in terms of complexity, it's still order n.\\n5:18 Because I still on average have-- not average.\\n5:20 In the worst case, I'm still going\\n5:22 to be looking n times through the loop\\n5:24 before I get to a point where I can decide to bail out of it.\\n5:27 So order n.\\n5:30 And then finally-- last piece of recap-- bisection search.\\n5:35 Repeat again.\\n5:35 The idea here is, take the midpoint of the list.\\n5:39 Look at that element.\\n5:40 If it's the thing I'm looking for, great.\\n5:42 I just won the lottery.\\n5:43 If it isn't, decide is the thing I'm\\n5:45 looking for bigger or less than that middle point.\\n5:49 If it's bigger than that, I only use the upper half of the list.\\n5:53 If it's less than that, I only use the lower half of the list.\\n5:57 And the characteristic here was, at each step,\\n6:00 I'm reducing the size of the problem in half.\",\n          \"15:01 And then I'm going to loop.\\n15:02 As long as swap is false-- so the first time through it's\\n15:05 going to do that loop.\\n15:07 I set swap initially to true, and notice what I then do.\\n15:11 I let j range from 1 up to the length of the list,\\n15:15 and I look at the jth element and the previous element.\\n15:19 If the previous element is bigger, I'm going to flip them.\\n15:23 Right there.\\n15:24 And that's just doing that swap, what I just did down here.\\n15:27 And if that's the case, I'm going to set the flag to false.\\n15:30 Which says, I've done at least one bubble as part of this.\\n15:33 Which means when I come out of here\\n15:35 and go back around to the loop, it's going to do it again.\\n15:37 And it will do it until all of this\\n15:41 succeeds without this ever being true, in which case\\n15:43 that's true, which makes that false.\\n15:45 And it will drop out.\\n15:47 OK?\\n15:50 Let's look at an example of this running.\\n15:52 It's just to give you a sense of that,\\n15:55 assuming I can find the right place here.\\n15:57 So there is, again, a version of bubble sort on the side.\\n16:01 And I'm going to bring this down to the bottom I've\\n16:03 got a little test list there.\\n16:05 And I've put a print statement in it.\\n16:07 So you can see each time through the loop,\\n16:09 what's the form of the list as it starts.\\n16:12 And assuming I've done this right-- here you go.\\n16:18 There's the list the first time through.\\n16:20 Notice after one pass, 25's at the end of the list--\\n16:23 the biggest element.\\n16:24 Exactly what I like.\\n16:25 But you can also see a few other things have flipped.\\n16:27 Right?\\n16:28 Right in there, there have been some other swaps\\n16:30 as it bubbled through.\\n16:32 And in fact, you can see it's-- well, you can see that idea.\\n16:35 You can see 25 moving through.\\n16:38 Notice on the next step, a whole bunch of the list\\n16:42 is actually in the right order.\\n16:44 It's just because I got lucky.\\n16:45 All I can guarantee is that the second largest\\n16:47 element is the second from the end of the list.\\n16:51 But you can see here.\\n16:52 Even though the list is, I think,\\n16:53 nine long, it only took us four passes through.\\n16:57 So this is nice.\\n16:57 It says, at most, n times through the list.\\n17:01 And at the end, we actually get out\\n17:02 something that's in the right form.\\n17:06 OK.\\n17:07 So let's go back to this and basically say,\\n17:09 what's the complexity?\\n17:13 Well that's length n, right?\\n17:15 Has to be.\\n17:16 I'm going through the entire list.\\n17:18 And inside of there is just constant work.\\n17:24 Four operations.\\n17:25 I'm doing a test.\\n17:26 Sorry, five.\\n17:26 I'm doing a test.\\n17:27 And then depending whether that test is true or not,\\n17:29 I'm setting a flag and doing some movement of things around.\\n17:32 But it's just constant.\\n17:33 I don't care about the five.\\n17:35 And there, how many times do I go around the loop?\\n17:39 In the worst case, n.\\n17:42 All I can guarantee is, after the first pass\\n17:44 the biggest thing is here.\\n17:45 After the second pass, the second biggest thing is there.\\n17:47 After the third pass-- you get the idea.\\n17:50 So I've got order and things inside the loop,\\n17:54 and I'm doing that loop n times.\\n17:57 And I hope that looks familiar.\\n17:58 We've talked about this.\\n18:00 Right?\\n18:00 This is nested loops.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

algorithm\\n0:41 as the size of the input grows?\\n0:43 And as I've said several times, I'll\\n0:44 say at least once more, how do we also\\n0:46 turn it the other direction?\\n0:47 How do we use thoughts about choices of pieces of algorithm\\n0:52 in terms of implications on the cost\\n0:54 it's going to take us to compute?\\n0:56 We saw last time a set of examples-- constant algorithms,\\n1:01 linear algorithms, logarithmic algorithms, linear algorithms,\\n1:06 quadratic algorithms, exponential algorithms.\\n1:09 Today, what I'm going to do is fill\\n1:11 in one more piece, a log linear algorithm-- something that's\\n1:14 really a nice kind of algorithm to have-- and use it to talk\\n1:18 about one last class of algorithms that\\n1:20 are really valuable, and those are searching and sorting\\n1:23 algorithms.\\n1:25 So a search algorithm.\\n1:27 Kind of an obvious statement.\\n1:29 You use them all the time when you go to Google or Bing\\n1:31 or whatever your favorite search mechanism on the web is.\\n1:35 It's just a way to find an item or a group of items\\n1:39 from a collection.\\n1:41 If you think about it, that collection\\n1:43 could be either implicit or explicit.\\n1:47 So way back at the beginning of the term,\\n1:48 we saw an example of a search algorithm\\n1:50 when you were looking for square roots.\\n1:53 And we saw simple things like exhaustive enumeration.\\n1:56 We'd go through all the possibilities.\\n1:58 We saw our first version of bisection search\\n2:00 there, where you would do approximations.\\n2:02 Newton-Raphson-- these are all examples of a search algorithm\\n2:05 where the collection is implicit.\\n2:08 So all the numbers between some point that some other point.\\n2:11 More common is a search algorithm\\n2:13 where the collection is explicit.\\n2:16 I don't know.\\n2:16 For example, I've got all the data records of students\\n2:19 and I want to know how do I find a particular student,\\n2:22 so I can record that A plus that everybody in this room\\n2:24 is going to get next Tuesday on that exam?\\n2:27 That's not a promise.\\n2:28 Sorry.\\n2:29 But we'll work on it.\\n2:30 So could do it implicit, could do it explicit.\\n2:33 Today I want to focus on doing search explicitly.\\n2:36 And it could be on different kinds of collections,\\n2:39 but I'm going to focus-- just as an example-- on search\\n2:41 over lists.\\n2:42 And to make it a little easier, let's just do search\\n2:45 over lists of numbers.\\n2:46 But it could obviously be other kinds of elements.\\n2:49 Now you've already seen some of this, right?\\n2:51 We did search where we said, we can do linear search.\\n2:54 Brute force.\\n2:55 Just walk down the list looking at everything\\n2:57 till we either find the thing we're looking for\\n3:00 or we get to the end of the list.\",\n          \"3:02 Sometimes also called British Museum algorithm\\n3:04 or exhaustive enumeration.\\n3:05 I go through everything in the list.\\n3:07 Nice news is, the list doesn't have to be sorted.\\n3:10 It could be just in arbitrary order.\\n3:12 What we saw is that the expected-- sorry, not expected.\\n3:16 The worst case behavior is linear.\\n3:18 In the worst case, the element's not in the list.\\n3:20 I got to look at everything.\\n3:21 So it's going to be linear in terms of complexity.\\n3:24 And then we looked at bisection search,\\n3:26 where we said the list needs to be sorted.\\n3:29 But if it is, we can actually be much more efficient\\n3:32 because we can take advantage of the sorting to cut down\\n3:36 the size of the problem.\\n3:38 And I'll remind you about both of those.\\n3:39 There was our simple little linear search.\\n3:42 Right?\\n3:42 Set a flag that says, I haven't yet found it.\\n3:45 And then just loop over the indices into the list.\\n3:48 I could have also just looped directly over the list\\n3:50 itself, checking to see if the ith member of the list\\n3:53 is the thing I'm looking for.\\n3:55 If it is, change the flag to true\\n3:57 so that when I come out of all of this\\n3:59 I'll return the flag-- either false because it\\n4:01 was set that way initially or true because I found it.\\n4:03 And of course what we knew is we have to look at everything\\n4:06 to see if it's there or not.\\n4:08 I could speed this up by just returning true at this point.\\n4:12 While that would improve the average case,\\n4:15 doesn't improve the worst case.\\n4:17 And that's the thing we usually are concerned about,\\n4:18 because in the worst case I've got to go through everything.\\n4:21 And just to remind you, we said this\\n4:22 is order length of the list.\\n4:24 To go around this part-- the loop right\\n4:26 here-- and inside the loop, it's constant work.\\n4:30 I'm doing the same number of things each time.\\n4:32 That's order n times order 1.\\n4:35 And by our rules, that's just order n.\\n4:36 So it's linear in the size of the problem.\\n4:41 OK.\\n4:42 We said we could do it on sorted lists.\\n4:45 But just again, we'll walk down the list.\\n4:47 Again, here I could loop over everything in the list,\\n4:50 checking to see if it's the thing I want.\\n4:52 Return true.\\n4:53 And if I ever get to a point where the element of the list\\n4:56 is bigger than the thing I'm looking for,\\n4:59 I know it can't be in the rest of the list\\n5:01 because all the things to the right are bigger yet.\\n5:03 I could just Return false and drop out.\\n5:06 In terms of average behavior, this\\n5:08 is better because it's going to stop\\n5:10 as soon as it gets to a point where it\\n5:11 can rule everything else out.\\n5:14 But in terms of complexity, it's still order n.\\n5:18 Because I still on average have-- not average.\\n5:20 In the worst case, I'm still going\\n5:22 to be looking n times through the loop\\n5:24 before I get to a point where I can decide to bail out of it.\\n5:27 So order n.\\n5:30 And then finally-- last piece of recap-- bisection search.\\n5:35 Repeat again.\\n5:35 The idea here is, take the midpoint of the list.\\n5:39 Look at that element.\\n5:40 If it's the thing I'm looking for, great.\\n5:42 I just won the lottery.\\n5:43 If it isn't, decide is the thing I'm\\n5:45 looking for bigger or less than that middle point.\\n5:49 If it's bigger than that, I only use the upper half of the list.\\n5:53 If it's less than that, I only use the lower half of the list.\\n5:57 And the characteristic here was, at each step,\\n6:00 I'm reducing the size of the problem in half.\",\n          \"15:01 And then I'm going to loop.\\n15:02 As long as swap is false-- so the first time through it's\\n15:05 going to do that loop.\\n15:07 I set swap initially to true, and notice what I then do.\\n15:11 I let j range from 1 up to the length of the list,\\n15:15 and I look at the jth element and the previous element.\\n15:19 If the previous element is bigger, I'm going to flip them.\\n15:23 Right there.\\n15:24 And that's just doing that swap, what I just did down here.\\n15:27 And if that's the case, I'm going to set the flag to false.\\n15:30 Which says, I've done at least one bubble as part of this.\\n15:33 Which means when I come out of here\\n15:35 and go back around to the loop, it's going to do it again.\\n15:37 And it will do it until all of this\\n15:41 succeeds without this ever being true, in which case\\n15:43 that's true, which makes that false.\\n15:45 And it will drop out.\\n15:47 OK?\\n15:50 Let's look at an example of this running.\\n15:52 It's just to give you a sense of that,\\n15:55 assuming I can find the right place here.\\n15:57 So there is, again, a version of bubble sort on the side.\\n16:01 And I'm going to bring this down to the bottom I've\\n16:03 got a little test list there.\\n16:05 And I've put a print statement in it.\\n16:07 So you can see each time through the loop,\\n16:09 what's the form of the list as it starts.\\n16:12 And assuming I've done this right-- here you go.\\n16:18 There's the list the first time through.\\n16:20 Notice after one pass, 25's at the end of the list--\\n16:23 the biggest element.\\n16:24 Exactly what I like.\\n16:25 But you can also see a few other things have flipped.\\n16:27 Right?\\n16:28 Right in there, there have been some other swaps\\n16:30 as it bubbled through.\\n16:32 And in fact, you can see it's-- well, you can see that idea.\\n16:35 You can see 25 moving through.\\n16:38 Notice on the next step, a whole bunch of the list\\n16:42 is actually in the right order.\\n16:44 It's just because I got lucky.\\n16:45 All I can guarantee is that the second largest\\n16:47 element is the second from the end of the list.\\n16:51 But you can see here.\\n16:52 Even though the list is, I think,\\n16:53 nine long, it only took us four passes through.\\n16:57 So this is nice.\\n16:57 It says, at most, n times through the list.\\n17:01 And at the end, we actually get out\\n17:02 something that's in the right form.\\n17:06 OK.\\n17:07 So let's go back to this and basically say,\\n17:09 what's the complexity?\\n17:13 Well that's length n, right?\\n17:15 Has to be.\\n17:16 I'm going through the entire list.\\n17:18 And inside of there is just constant work.\\n17:24 Four operations.\\n17:25 I'm doing a test.\\n17:26 Sorry, five.\\n17:26 I'm doing a test.\\n17:27 And then depending whether that test is true or not,\\n17:29 I'm setting a flag and doing some movement of things around.\\n17:32 But it's just constant.\\n17:33 I don't care about the five.\\n17:35 And there, how many times do I go around the loop?\\n17:39 In the worst case, n.\\n17:42 All I can guarantee is, after the first pass\\n17:44 the biggest thing is here.\\n17:45 After the second pass, the second biggest thing is there.\\n17:47 After the third pass-- you get the idea.\\n17:50 So I've got order and things inside the loop,\\n17:54 and I'm doing that loop n times.\\n17:57 And I hope that looks familiar.\\n17:58 We've talked about this.\\n18:00 Right?\\n18:00 This is nested loops.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

time.\\n0:33 So last time we introduced this idea of decomposition\\n0:36 and abstraction.\\n0:37 And we started putting that into our programs.\\n0:39 And these were sort of high level concepts,\\n0:41 and we achieved them using these concrete things called\\n0:45 functions in our programs.\\n0:46 And functions allowed us to create\\n0:47 code that was coherent, that had some structure to it,\\n0:53 and was reusable.\\n0:55 OK.\\n0:57 And from now on in problem sets and in lectures,\\n0:59 I\\'m going to be using functions a lot.\\n1:01 So make sure that you understand how they work\\n1:04 and all of those details.\\n1:05 So today, we\\'re going to introduce two new data types.\\n1:09 And they\\'re called compound data types,\\n1:11 because they\\'re actually data types that are made up\\n1:13 of other data types, particularly ints, floats,\\n1:17 Booleans, and strings.\\n1:19 And actually not just these, but other data types as well.\\n1:22 So that\\'s why they\\'re called compound data types.\\n1:24 So we\\'re going to look at a new data\\n1:27 type called a tuple and a new data type called a list.\\n1:30 And then we\\'re going to talk about these ideas that\\n1:32 come about with-- specifically with lists.\\n1:38 All right.\\n1:38 So let\\'s go right into tuples.\\n1:41 So if you recall strings, strings\\n1:44 were sequences of characters.\\n1:47 Tuples are going to be similar to strings in that they\\'re\\n1:50 going to be sequences of something,\\n1:52 except that tuples aren\\'t just sequences of characters,\\n1:55 they can be sequences of anything.\\n1:57 They\\'re a collection of data where\\n1:59 that data can be of any type.\\n2:05 So a tuple can contain elements that are integers,\\n2:08 floats, strings, and so on.\\n2:13 Tuples are immutable.\\n2:14 And if you recall, we talked about this word a little bit\\n2:17 when we talked about strings.\\n2:19 So that means once you create a tuple object,\\n2:21 you can\\'t modify it.\\n2:22 So when you created a string object,\\n2:24 you were not allowed to modify it.\\n2:30 So the way we create tuples are with these open and close\\n2:33 parentheses.\\n2:36 This shouldn\\'t be confused with a function,\\n2:38 because there\\'s nothing-- there\\'s no--\\n2:41 this isn\\'t a function call.\\n2:42 It\\'s just how you represent a tuple.\\n2:44 For a function call, you\\'d have something right\\n2:46 before the parentheses.\\n2:48 This is just how we chose to represent a tuple.\\n2:53 And just a plain open and close parentheses\\n2:54 represents an empty tuple.\\n2:56

did last time.\\n0:33 So last time we introduced this idea of decomposition\\n0:36 and abstraction.\\n0:37 And we started putting that into our programs.\\n0:39 And these were sort of high level concepts,\\n0:41 and we achieved them using these concrete things called\\n0:45 functions in our programs.\\n0:46 And functions allowed us to create\\n0:47 code that was coherent, that had some structure to it,\\n0:53 and was reusable.\\n0:55 OK.\\n0:57 And from now on in problem sets and in lectures,\\n0:59 I'm going to be using functions a lot.\\n1:01 So make sure that you understand how they work\\n1:04 and all of those details.\\n1:05 So today, we're going to introduce two new data types.\\n1:09 And they're called compound data types,\\n1:11 because they're actually data types that are made up\\n1:13 of other data types, particularly ints, floats,\\n1:17 Booleans, and strings.\\n1:19 And actually not just these, but other data types as well.\\n1:22 So that's why they're called compound data types.\\n1:24 So we're going to look at a new data\\n1:27 type called a tuple and a new data type called a list.\\n1:30 And then we're going to talk about these ideas that\\n1:32 come about with-- specifically with lists.\\n1:38 All right.\\n1:38 So let's go right into tuples.\\n1:41 So if you recall strings, strings\\n1:44 were sequences of characters.\\n1:47 Tuples are going to be similar to strings in that they're\\n1:50 going to be sequences of something,\\n1:52 except that tuples aren't just sequences of characters,\\n1:55 they can be sequences of anything.\\n1:57 They're a collection of data where\\n1:59 that data can be of any type.\\n2:05 So a tuple can contain elements that are integers,\\n2:08 floats, strings, and so on.\\n2:13 Tuples are immutable.\\n2:14 And if you recall, we talked about this word a little bit\\n2:17 when we talked about strings.\\n2:19 So that means once you create a tuple object,\\n2:21 you can't modify it.\\n2:22 So when you created a string object,\\n2:24 you were not allowed to modify it.\\n2:30 So the way we create tuples are with these open and close\\n2:33 parentheses.\\n2:36 This shouldn't be confused with a function,\\n2:38 because there's nothing-- there's no--\\n2:41 this isn't a function call.\\n2:42 It's just how you represent a tuple.\\n2:44 For a function call, you'd have something right\\n2:46 before the parentheses.\\n2:48 This is just how we chose to represent a tuple.\\n2:53 And just a plain open and close parentheses\\n2:54 represents an empty tuple.\\n2:56 So it's of length 0.\\n2:57 There's nothing in it.\\n3:00 You can create a tuple that contains\\n3:02 some elements by separating each element with a comma.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

of an algorithm\\n0:41 as the size of the input grows?\\n0:43 And as I've said several times, I'll\\n0:44 say at least once more, how do we also\\n0:46 turn it the other direction?\\n0:47 How do we use thoughts about choices of pieces of algorithm\\n0:52 in terms of implications on the cost\\n0:54 it's going to take us to compute?\\n0:56 We saw last time a set of examples-- constant algorithms,\\n1:01 linear algorithms, logarithmic algorithms, linear algorithms,\\n1:06 quadratic algorithms, exponential algorithms.\\n1:09 Today, what I'm going to do is fill\\n1:11 in one more piece, a log linear algorithm-- something that's\\n1:14 really a nice kind of algorithm to have-- and use it to talk\\n1:18 about one last class of algorithms that\\n1:20 are really valuable, and those are searching and sorting\\n1:23 algorithms.\\n1:25 So a search algorithm.\\n1:27 Kind of an obvious statement.\\n1:29 You use them all the time when you go to Google or Bing\\n1:31 or whatever your favorite search mechanism on the web is.\\n1:35 It's just a way to find an item or a group of items\\n1:39 from a collection.\\n1:41 If you think about it, that collection\\n1:43 could be either implicit or explicit.\\n1:47 So way back at the beginning of the term,\\n1:48 we saw an example of a search algorithm\\n1:50 when you were looking for square roots.\\n1:53 And we saw simple things like exhaustive enumeration.\\n1:56 We'd go through all the possibilities.\\n1:58 We saw our first version of bisection search\\n2:00 there, where you would do approximations.\\n2:02 Newton-Raphson-- these are all examples of a search algorithm\\n2:05 where the collection is implicit.\\n2:08 So all the numbers between some point that some other point.\\n2:11 More common is a search algorithm\\n2:13 where the collection is explicit.\\n2:16 I don't know.\\n2:16 For example, I've got all the data records of students\\n2:19 and I want to know how do I find a particular student,\\n2:22 so I can record that A plus that everybody in this room\\n2:24 is going to get next Tuesday on that exam?\\n2:27 That's not a promise.\\n2:28 Sorry.\\n2:29 But we'll work on it.\\n2:30 So could do it implicit, could do it explicit.\\n2:33 Today I want to focus on doing search explicitly.\\n2:36 And it could be on different kinds of collections,\\n2:39 but I'm going to focus-- just as an example-- on search\\n2:41 over lists.\\n2:42 And to make it a little easier, let's just do search\\n2:45 over lists of numbers.\\n2:46 But it could obviously be other kinds of elements.\\n2:49 Now you've already seen some of this, right?\\n2:51 We did search where we said, we can do linear search.\\n2:54 Brute force.\\n2:55 Just walk down the list looking at everything\\n2:57 till we either find the thing we're looking for\\n3:00 or we get to the end of the list.\",\n          \"3:02 Sometimes also called British Museum algorithm\\n3:04 or exhaustive enumeration.\\n3:05 I go through everything in the list.\\n3:07 Nice news is, the list doesn't have to be sorted.\\n3:10 It could be just in arbitrary order.\\n3:12 What we saw is that the expected-- sorry, not expected.\\n3:16 The worst case behavior is linear.\\n3:18 In the worst case, the element's not in the list.\\n3:20 I got to look at everything.\\n3:21 So it's going to be linear in terms of complexity.\\n3:24 And then we looked at bisection search,\\n3:26 where we said the list needs to be sorted.\\n3:29 But if it is, we can actually be much more efficient\\n3:32 because we can take advantage of the sorting to cut down\\n3:36 the size of the problem.\\n3:38 And I'll remind you about both of those.\\n3:39 There was our simple little linear search.\\n3:42 Right?\\n3:42 Set a flag that says, I haven't yet found it.\\n3:45 And then just loop over the indices into the list.\\n3:48 I could have also just looped directly over the list\\n3:50 itself, checking to see if the ith member of the list\\n3:53 is the thing I'm looking for.\\n3:55 If it is, change the flag to true\\n3:57 so that when I come out of all of this\\n3:59 I'll return the flag-- either false because it\\n4:01 was set that way initially or true because I found it.\\n4:03 And of course what we knew is we have to look at everything\\n4:06 to see if it's there or not.\\n4:08 I could speed this up by just returning true at this point.\\n4:12 While that would improve the average case,\\n4:15 doesn't improve the worst case.\\n4:17 And that's the thing we usually are concerned about,\\n4:18 because in the worst case I've got to go through everything.\\n4:21 And just to remind you, we said this\\n4:22 is order length of the list.\\n4:24 To go around this part-- the loop right\\n4:26 here-- and inside the loop, it's constant work.\\n4:30 I'm doing the same number of things each time.\\n4:32 That's order n times order 1.\\n4:35 And by our rules, that's just order n.\\n4:36 So it's linear in the size of the problem.\\n4:41 OK.\\n4:42 We said we could do it on sorted lists.\\n4:45 But just again, we'll walk down the list.\\n4:47 Again, here I could loop over everything in the list,\\n4:50 checking to see if it's the thing I want.\\n4:52 Return true.\\n4:53 And if I ever get to a point where the element of the list\\n4:56 is bigger than the thing I'm looking for,\\n4:59 I know it can't be in the rest of the list\\n5:01 because all the things to the right are bigger yet.\\n5:03 I could just Return false and drop out.\\n5:06 In terms of average behavior, this\\n5:08 is better because it's going to stop\\n5:10 as soon as it gets to a point where it\\n5:11 can rule everything else out.\\n5:14 But in terms of complexity, it's still order n.\\n5:18 Because I still on average have-- not average.\\n5:20 In the worst case, I'm still going\\n5:22 to be looking n times through the loop\\n5:24 before I get to a point where I can decide to bail out of it.\\n5:27 So order n.\\n5:30 And then finally-- last piece of recap-- bisection search.\\n5:35 Repeat again.\\n5:35 The idea here is, take the midpoint of the list.\\n5:39 Look at that element.\\n5:40 If it's the thing I'm looking for, great.\\n5:42 I just won the lottery.\\n5:43 If it isn't, decide is the thing I'm\\n5:45 looking for bigger or less than that middle point.\\n5:49 If it's bigger than that, I only use the upper half of the list.\\n5:53 If it's less than that, I only use the lower half of the list.\\n5:57 And the characteristic here was, at each step,\\n6:00 I'm reducing the size of the problem in half.\",\n          \"15:01 And then I'm going to loop.\\n15:02 As long as swap is false-- so the first time through it's\\n15:05 going to do that loop.\\n15:07 I set swap initially to true, and notice what I then do.\\n15:11 I let j range from 1 up to the length of the list,\\n15:15 and I look at the jth element and the previous element.\\n15:19 If the previous element is bigger, I'm going to flip them.\\n15:23 Right there.\\n15:24 And that's just doing that swap, what I just did down here.\\n15:27 And if that's the case, I'm going to set the flag to false.\\n15:30 Which says, I've done at least one bubble as part of this.\\n15:33 Which means when I come out of here\\n15:35 and go back around to the loop, it's going to do it again.\\n15:37 And it will do it until all of this\\n15:41 succeeds without this ever being true, in which case\\n15:43 that's true, which makes that false.\\n15:45 And it will drop out.\\n15:47 OK?\\n15:50 Let's look at an example of this running.\\n15:52 It's just to give you a sense of that,\\n15:55 assuming I can find the right place here.\\n15:57 So there is, again, a version of bubble sort on the side.\\n16:01 And I'm going to bring this down to the bottom I've\\n16:03 got a little test list there.\\n16:05 And I've put a print statement in it.\\n16:07 So you can see each time through the loop,\\n16:09 what's the form of the list as it starts.\\n16:12 And assuming I've done this right-- here you go.\\n16:18 There's the list the first time through.\\n16:20 Notice after one pass, 25's at the end of the list--\\n16:23 the biggest element.\\n16:24 Exactly what I like.\\n16:25 But you can also see a few other things have flipped.\\n16:27 Right?\\n16:28 Right in there, there have been some other swaps\\n16:30 as it bubbled through.\\n16:32 And in fact, you can see it's-- well, you can see that idea.\\n16:35 You can see 25 moving through.\\n16:38 Notice on the next step, a whole bunch of the list\\n16:42 is actually in the right order.\\n16:44 It's just because I got lucky.\\n16:45 All I can guarantee is that the second largest\\n16:47 element is the second from the end of the list.\\n16:51 But you can see here.\\n16:52 Even though the list is, I think,\\n16:53 nine long, it only took us four passes through.\\n16:57 So this is nice.\\n16:57 It says, at most, n times through the list.\\n17:01 And at the end, we actually get out\\n17:02 something that's in the right form.\\n17:06 OK.\\n17:07 So let's go back to this and basically say,\\n17:09 what's the complexity?\\n17:13 Well that's length n, right?\\n17:15 Has to be.\\n17:16 I'm going through the entire list.\\n17:18 And inside of there is just constant work.\\n17:24 Four operations.\\n17:25 I'm doing a test.\\n17:26 Sorry, five.\\n17:26 I'm doing a test.\\n17:27 And then depending whether that test is true or not,\\n17:29 I'm setting a flag and doing some movement of things around.\\n17:32 But it's just constant.\\n17:33 I don't care about the five.\\n17:35 And there, how many times do I go around the loop?\\n17:39 In the worst case, n.\\n17:42 All I can guarantee is, after the first pass\\n17:44 the biggest thing is here.\\n17:45 After the second pass, the second biggest thing is there.\\n17:47 After the third pass-- you get the idea.\\n17:50 So I've got order and things inside the loop,\\n17:54 and I'm doing that loop n times.\\n17:57 And I hope that looks familiar.\\n17:58 We've talked about this.\\n18:00 Right?\\n18:00 This is nested loops.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
